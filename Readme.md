## Showcase

You can get a taste of usage for the components by looking at the [`showcase`](./examples/showcase). This also provides a good example of how to use `byewlma` in a project. Run the showcase using [`trunk`](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk):

```bash
cd ./examples/showcase && trunk serve --open
```

## Customizing Bulma

Bulma can be customized through a number of `sass` variables. The [`showcase`](./examples/showcase) example uses standard bulma colors, but the [`customize`](./examples/customize) example shows a very simple example of using different variables.

For further customization, see the [`trunk`](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk) documentation
